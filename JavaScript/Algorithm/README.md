# Exercise in Autonomy

## Part 1

### Exercise 1
You know that the eclipse will occur on the 12581st day and the current date is the 11937th day. Your program must calculate and display the number of days it will take before you can see the eclipse.

### Exercise 2
The school is made up of 4 classes, made up of 25, 30, 27 and 22 students respectively. However, 8 students are absent today. Knowing that each student must receive 3 candies, write a program that calculates and displays the total number of candies needed.

### Exercise 3
The event consists of three stages to be completed each day: 2 km of swimming, 34 km of cycling and 6 km of running.
Knowing that an athlete repeats these three steps for 3 days in a row, you must display the total distance covered at the end of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd days.
In order to make the display more readable, you will put the values on the same line, with a space between each value and the following one.

### Exercise 4
A square yard was measured with four sticks of respective lengths 17 m, 7 m, 5 m and 3 m. The length of the side of the court is equal to 5 times the first stick plus 2 times the second plus 3 times the third plus 2 times the fourth.
You must display two rows: the first must contain the area of the yard, and the second must contain the perimeter.

## Part 2

### Exercise 1
Create an algorithm to give the state of water according to its temperature. If the water is less than or equal to 0°C then the state of the water is solid, if the temperature is between 0 and 100°C then the state of the water is liquid and if the temperature of the water is higher than 100°C then the state of the water will be gaseous.

### Exercise 2
Residents of The Shire pay tax according to the following rules:
    • Men over 20 pay tax
    • Women pay tax if they are between 18 and 35 years old
    • Others don't pay tax
The program will therefore ask for the Hobbit's age and sex, and will display whether the habitant is taxable or not.

### Exercise 3
This algorithm will read the hour, the minutes and the seconds from the keyboard and it will display the time that it will be one second later.

### Exercise 4
An insurance company has identifiable rates according to a color criterion, from the cheapest to the most expensive: blue, green, orange and red. The price depends on the situation of the driver.
    • A driver under 25, who has held the license for less than two years, obtains the red rate, if he has never had an accident, otherwise he is not insurable.
    • A driver under 25, who has held the license for more than two years or who is over 25 but who has held the license for less than two years gets the orange rate, if he has never had an accident, red if he had one, otherwise he is not insurable.
    • A driver over 25, who has held a license for more than two years, gets a green rate if he has never had an accident, orange if he has had one, red if he has had two, otherwise he is not insurable.
To encourage loyalty, the company offers to switch to the more advantageous rate if the customer has been insured for more than a year. Green becomes blue, orange becomes green, and red becomes orange.
Write the algorithm for entering the necessary data and dealing with this problem.

## Part 3

### Exercise 1
The program will have to start the countdown starting from 100 and then announce the takeoff.

### Exercise 2
There are currently 1337 toads and their number doubles every week, your program should display the number of toads there will be after the 12th week.

### Exercise 3
If you hit a target on the 1st shot you win 1 candy, on the 2nd shot you win 2 more candies, on the 3rd shot you win 3 more candies, ... Write a program that displays the total number of candies on the 1st line obtained if 1 shot is successful, then on the 2nd line if 2 shots are successful, ... up to the total amount of candies for the 50th shot success.

### Exercise 4
A tower is built using wooden cubes placed one above the other. The base of the tower is a 17x17x17 cube, i.e. composed of 17x17x17 = 4913 small cubes. On this cube is placed another cube of 15x15x15, then another cube of 13x13x13 to the top which is composed of a cube of 1x1x1.
Your program should calculate and display the total number of small cubes needed to build the tower, including a loop.

### Exercise 5
A teacher lost her 20x20 multiplication table. You need to create a new one for him.

### Exercise 7
Write an algorithm that calculates and displays the average of n numbers entered on the keyboard.

### Exercise 8
Write an algorithm that reads the following n entire price of a customer's purchases. Calculate the amount to be paid, read the amount paid and simulate the delivery of change.
